PORT = 90 ## overrides port
$PORT = 900 ## overrides PORT
proxyport = 80 # On which port the app runs on 
proxyportssl = 80
host = localhost # IP or Hostname where you will access service on the internet. Is this still in use?
mongodb = mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/casket?authSource=admin # Add connection string
redis = redis://redis:6379 # If you are running on a cluster, add redis for shared memory
webmaster = true # Set to true if you are deploying using docker-compose (npm run build)
